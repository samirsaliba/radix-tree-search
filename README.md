# radix-tree-search
Mapping the occurrence of words in a text using a Radix Tree (PATRICIA)

Running: on the main folder run the following code in the terminal:
javac word_mapping/*.java && java word_mapping.WordMap

The code gets the text from the teste.txt file, splits the text into words (using the delimitators set in the delimitadores.txt file) and saves them and their occurrence in a Radix Tree (PATRICIA).
The tree can then be searched for any words contained or not in the text.
