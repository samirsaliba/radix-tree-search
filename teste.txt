John Mullan on William Gibson’s Neuromancer – Guardian book club
The first-time reader of William Gibson’s Neuromancer, if unacquainted with any of Gibson’s other novels, is likely to be perplexed and disoriented.
Perplexed, from being absorbed into some undateable future world governed by an advanced technology whose capacities have to be learned as one reads.
Disoriented, as a result of the novel’s transformation of our very idea of physical space – a transformation that deeply influenced science fiction writers, and indeed film-makers, who followed Gibson.

Neuromancer does have the rudiments of a traditional novel: a protagonist and a plot. Henry Case is a computer hacker rescued from death by a shadowy organisation that needs his skills to break into the computer systems of another organisation. Case (forename redundant, like any good hard-boiled antihero) is a recognisable type purloined from detective fiction: hard-bitten, brave, apparently cynical but in fact humane. The novel’s plot turns, like much dystopian SF, on the deep-laid schemes of an almost but not quite omnipotent agency. In the universe Gibson imagines, the most powerful beings are AIs (artificial intelligences). Our antihero struggles to be anything but a pawn in their game. 1111

But the novel is not much interested in character and plot. Instead it is dedicated to creating the feeling of a transformed reality, where a new vocabulary is required to describe how perception itself has been changed by computers. Real space is contracted, even trivial: Case, usually following mysterious instructions, moves easily from Japan to the east coast of the US (now one giant conurbation) to Turkey to Paris. Journeys seems almost instant, in silent magnetic trains or superfast planes.

A different kind of space, however, stretches away in front of him and us. This is the dimension for which Gibson invented a word that is lodged in our language: cyberspace. In fact, Gibson had first used it in a short story published in 1982, two years before Neuromancer appeared. In this, his first novel, it becomes dominant (his use of the word is duly credited in the Oxford English Dictionary). Gibson writes: “Cyberspace. A consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators.” This is the space, also called “the Matrix”, where Case really comes alive. “Case … gazed out across the plateaus of the Eastern Seaboard Fission Authority, into the infinite neuroelectronic void of the matrix”. The journeys that are described in any detail are through cyberspace. “Dizzying sensation of headlong movement, colours, whipping around corners and through narrow corridors.”
